# PURPOSE

This repository manages dotfiles configurations. Dotfiles are configuration files in Unix-like systems that customize the behavior of applications and shell environments. They are called "dotfiles" because they typically begin with a dot (.) making them hidden files by default.

Key aspects:
- Centralizes configuration management
- Enables version control of settings
- Facilitates easy setup on new systems
- Maintains consistency across different machines

# PACKAGE MANAGEMENT

The repository uses a declarative approach to manage package installation through a unified script:
- Platform-specific package managers (e.g., MacPorts on macOS)
- Cross-platform shell-based installations that work on any supported system
- UV tool package installations for Python packages
